# Trackerbot
Python script that checks if provided webpages were updated and in that case sends you a telegram message.

Requires you to set up a [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots "More info here"), and for you to know your personal [Telegram user_id](https://bigone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008014894-How-to-get-the-Telegram-user-ID- "More info here").

Set it up as you like. I suggest making it a daemon via systemd or crontab.
